title: Advice for attending your first open-source conference
---

As I mentioned in [my summary of DjangoCon Europe 2018]({% post_url 2018-05-29-djangocon %}), the most important thing I learned was *how* to attend conferences like DjangoCon.

## Know your learning style

Some people best learn complex technical concepts by reading books. Some people do better listening to people explain those concepts. Personally, I learn best by doing.

## â€¦but be prepared to ignore it

## Be social

## Give yourself time

Travel takes time. If you're travelling, arrive at least one day before the conference, and leave the day after it ends at the earliest. Give yourself some time around the conference. Don't try to cram in tourism in while the conference is happening.
