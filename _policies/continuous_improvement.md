title: Continuous Improvement Policy
---

UHF 62 strives to get better at everything we do.

## Continuous Improvement of Technical Skills

We'll participate in code reviews. These are a great way to expose yourself to different styles, techniques and functionality that you may have forgotten or be ignorant of.

We'll attend meetups, talks and conferences.

When they arise, we'll take opportunities to learn about new approaches and different languages.

## Continuous Improvement of Policies

Our policies are not set in stone and are subject to change.

The directors of UHF 62 will try to meet and get to know like-minded people, develop meaningful relationships with them, learn from them, and feed the things we learn back into these policies.
