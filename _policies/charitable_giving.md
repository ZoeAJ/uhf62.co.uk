title: Charitable Giving Policy

UHF 62 will donate 4% of our income to charities.

Charities are chosen on a mixture of [effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) (that is, choosing charities and causes which deliver the greatest benefit) and causes which are relevant to UHF 62's staff.
